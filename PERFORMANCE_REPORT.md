## üîß Build Commands

```bash
# Development with optimizations
npm run dev

# Production build (optimized)
npm run build

# Lint and fix issues
npm run lint:fix

# Full optimization pipeline  
npm run optimize
```

## üìà Next Steps for Further Optimization

1. **Add Service Worker** for offline support
2. **Implement Virtual Scrolling** for large lists
3. **Add Prefetching** for critical routes
4. **WebP Image Support** with fallbacks
5. **Progressive Loading** for blog content

All critical issues have been resolved and the application is now production-ready with significant performance improvements!
