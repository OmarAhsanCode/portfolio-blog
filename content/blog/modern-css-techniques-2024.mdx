# Modern CSS Techniques for 2024

CSS continues to evolve rapidly, bringing powerful new features that make styling more intuitive and efficient. In this article, we'll explore the cutting-edge CSS techniques that are shaping web development in 2024.

## Container Queries: The Game Changer

Container queries allow you to style elements based on their container's size rather than the viewport size.

```css
.card-container {
  container-type: inline-size;
}

@container (min-width: 400px) {
  .card {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
  }
}
```

## CSS Grid Subgrid

Subgrid allows nested grids to participate in their parent's grid layout.

```css
.parent-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  gap: 1rem;
}

.child-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-column: span 2;
  grid-template-columns: subgrid;
}
```

## CSS Cascade Layers

Control the specificity of your styles with cascade layers.

```css
@layer base, components, utilities;

@layer base {
  h1 {
    font-size: 2rem;
  }
}

@layer components {
  .card h1 {
    font-size: 1.5rem;
  }
}
```

## New Color Functions

CSS now offers more sophisticated color manipulation.

```css
:root {
  --primary: oklch(0.7 0.15 200);
  --secondary: color-mix(in oklch, var(--primary), white 20%);
}

.element {
  color: var(--primary);
  background: var(--secondary);
}
```

## Conclusion

These modern CSS features are changing how we approach web styling. By adopting these techniques, you can create more maintainable, responsive, and beautiful web experiences.
